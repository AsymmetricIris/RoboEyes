## Assistive Device for Partial Sight Uncorrected by Glasses
## (Based on relativty/Relativty)
Some people's partial sight conditions cannot be easily corrected by wearing glasses. Technologies like VR goggles could easily be leveraged to assist these people with features such as a portable zoom lens and colour correction, and more.

Designing and implementing such a headset with minimal form factor and maximum battery life would also be very nice in order to avoid people asking "why does that blind guy run around with a giant block of plastic on his face?"
